There are some quirky things in Ubunutu that will chew up space .... the following commands will show you where it is being used..... 
sudo su
cd /
du -h -d1
then you can move into the dir with the most and work out where space is being used.
you can also do a du -h | sort -h 
this will give you a list of what directories and files have the most usage in order.
Look for something called apport .... it is a kind of crash dump and the files can all be deleted safely.
if it is apport then you can disable it by :
sudo service apport stop
sudo nano /etc/default/apport  (change enabled to 0)
or just uninstall it 
sudo apt-get purge apport

type exit to get out of su (your prompt will be a # instead of a $ if you are in su)

another area of concern is wandb.
run a du -h | sort -h from your home directory and you will find that the .cache/wandb is probably huge ....
you can purge records by age by going into .cache/wandb or wherever then 
find /some/dir -type f -mtime +5 -delete   (this will delete any files > 5 days old.... you can change this to whatever)

Finally if you have changed models you may still have some metadata from the old models, maybe @shibshib [τ, τ] or @Taco [τ, τ]  can help with a method to safely purge these.

Also check pm2 logs dir ..... ~/.pm2/logs ..... these can get large too ...
try a pm2 flush

you can also install a tool to manage these 
pm2 install pm2-logrotate
then
pm2 set pm2-logrotate:max_size 50M
pm2 set pm2-logrotate:retain 10
pm2 set pm2-logrotate:compress true

You should take a look at newrelic (www.newrelic.com) ... you can setup a free account and then run the agent on your machines and get alerts when they run out of disc space and other metrics also.
